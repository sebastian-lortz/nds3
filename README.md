I introduce the DISCOURSE framework – Data-simulation via Iterative
Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary Estimates.
The primary scope of the algorithmic framework is to reconstruct
complete datasets using only summary statistics, giving researchers a
way - when raw data are unavailable - to conduct follow-up analyses and
inform replication study decision‑making.

## Usage

The method is available as R package and comprehensive ShinyApp.

### Web App

You can use the app at
<https://sebastian-lortz.shinyapps.io/discourse/>. Expect longer
computation time compared to running the app locally.

### System Requirements

The `discourse` package was build under R Version 4.4.2 using Apple
clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.6) and GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0.
To compile R from source, install the appropriate toolchain  
- macOS: see <https://mac.r-project.org/tools/>  
- windows: see <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

### Installation

You can install the latest version of the R package `discourse` like so:

``` r
# install devtools if needed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) {install.packages("devtools")}

# install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("sebastian-lortz/discourse")
```

### Run

You can launch the ShinyApp locally by running:

``` r
discourse::run_app()
```
