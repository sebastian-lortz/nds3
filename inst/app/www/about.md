## About the Project

I introduce **nds3** – this algorithmic framework is designed to
reconstruct complete data sets solely from summary statistics. It
provides researchers with a tool to follow-up analyses even when raw
data are unavailable. nds3 is available as R package and shiny app
via Github page: <https://sebastian-lortz.github.io/nds3/>

### Publications

The method is introduced in the research project titled ‘Advancing
Replication Study Decision-Making with nds3: Data-simulation via
Iterative Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary
Estimates’.
