At each iteration, the following two steps are performed. Candidate Modification: Modifications to the data are produced through different types of moves (i.e., adjustments of the data) within the search space. Candidate Evaluation: Each candidate is evaluated by f and accepted based on a stochastic optimization criterion, ensuring that modifications progressively reduce the  value of f."),
